**html**
The html file used lots of t div tags that were replaced with semantics to clean up the code. Upon inspection of the code, I discovered a subpar title, broken link, and added alt tags for accessibility. 
**css**
I cleared up some redundant code and created classes for elements. In addition, I placed code in order.
